% TITLE: Talking about our tools
% [Libre Graphics Meeting special]


# Call for submissions

Let's talk about tools for a moment. We, as humans, distinguish 
ourselves from other animals by talking about our ability to make and 
use tools. We make tools, we use tools, we are tools, all at 
different times and in different amounts. 

Tools can be physical things used to manipulate equally physical 
things. At the same time, they can be digital things, used to shift 
bits. We can love them or hate them. The one thing we can't manage is 
to escape them. 

As we define what they do, so too do they define what we do. In the 
shape of a paint brush, the kink of a bezier curve, the change a 
gaussian filter exerts over an image, they make our work what it is. 
We are our tools and our tools are us. So let's talk about tools, in 
the best way we know how, graphically.

Libre Graphics Meeting, Libre Graphics magazine and Mardigrafe are 
co-sponsoring a juried exhibition of F/LOSS graphics work on the 
subject of tools. Break out your own F/LOSS graphics tools and design 
a poster (24"x34") detailing your perception or ideas about tools. 

All submissions will be included in an online gallery, presented in 
conjunction with Libre Graphics meeting. In addition, a jury of 
designers, thinkers and doers will meet in May. They'll pick 15 
posters to be printed by Mardigrafe and displayed during Libre 
Graphics Meeting in Montreal. The editors of Libre Graphics magazine 
will pick a further eight to be featured in the showcase section of 
an upcoming issue. 

So get thinking about your tools, what they mean to you and what you 
mean to them. Then, get designing.
