Please don’t tell us stories of grandparents who can now use technological
devices such as tablets whereas before they could never  master computers.
Just how much of the new technology have they  mastered?
Yes, gesture-controlled devices, tablets, and phones have easier barriers
to initial use. But they have huge barriers to anything advanced, such as
selecting three photos to send in an email, or formatting some text, or
combining the results of several different operations. These and myriad
other operations are far easier and more efficient on traditional computers.
