    Sed  is  a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to per-      \
    form basic text transformations on an input stream (a file      \
    or  input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to      \
    an editor which permits scripted edits (such as  ed),  sed      \
    works by  making only one  pass over  the input(s), and is      \
    consequently  more efficient.  But it is sed's  ability to      \
    filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes      \
    it from other types of editors.                                 \
