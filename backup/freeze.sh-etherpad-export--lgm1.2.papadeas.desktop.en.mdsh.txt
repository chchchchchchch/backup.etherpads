Desktop features clever hacks, workarounds and customizations used by 
designers and artists. We look at the way the best and brightest of 
our peers work.

This issue, Desktop features customizations used by Pierros Papadeas, 
a Fedora Ambassador and Maintainer of the Fedora Design Suite Spin. 

## Transparent Windows
A common drawing problem is layering info from different apps. GNOME 
with Desktop Effects gives you the ability to make a window 
transparent. It means being able to trace without having to go back 
and forth, saving, exporting and importing. This effect can also be 
achieved with other desktop environments. 

## Expose Windows
It's GNOME and Desktop Effects again. Just point your mouse at the 
upper right corner and you get an "Expose" of all windows. It allows 
you to easily change between windows and get a quick view of the huge 
amount of awesomeness you're working on.

In this instalment of Desktop, Pierros is using Fedora Linux, GNOME 
desktop environment with Desktop Effects, Inkscape and Alchemy.
