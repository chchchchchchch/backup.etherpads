The École de Recherche Graphique in Brussels has a history of 
introducing F/LOSS tools to its students. But in the autumn, 2010 
semester, it went all out. Ludi OSP taught the first instance of a 
class solely devoted to F/LOSS-based design tools and tactics. 
Collected below are reactions and recollections from the class, 
translated into English. 


Session 1 - September 24 
------------------------
% ACCORDING: Jérémy and Jiacinto 

The goal of this session was to explain the principles behind F/LOSS 
software (GIMP and others). These programs are conceived by 
programmers who have decided to develop, on Linux (to start). 
Freeware: These softwares are free to use and let the possibility 
open, for users capable of programming, to modify the code of the 
software and, by connection, its functions. Knowing that the license 
for a similar Adobe program might be 700€ and that it takes more 
than one program to make a work flow, freeware is something of 
obvious interest. 

! freeware ? open source ? libre and open source do not mean 
monetarily free 


The goal of our first project is to create an alphabet made up of 
photos. Choose a theme, take photos of objects which fit the theme. 
Each object has to start with a specific letter of the alphabet. 

The photos are then modified using GIMP, followed by Inkscape to turn 
a bitmap-based image (JPG, tiff, PSD in GIMP) into a vector-based 
image (the drawing is written by the computer in the form of 
coordinates and points, making it infinitely scalable, allowing scale 
changes without quality loss). Once in a vector format (.ai in Adobe 
Illustrator) the image can now be used as a font after some 
manipulation with FontForge. 

Onto the job, kids! 


Session 2 - October 1 
---------------------
% ACCORDING: Edwin and Flore 

In this session, we familiarized ourselves with pixels in order to 
better understand that digital image matrix (acquiring, creating, 
processing or storing in binary form). We also learned about the 
existence of a multitude of image formats like .tiff (for high 
quality, lossless images) or .jpg (images compressed with an 
algorithm which simplifies pixels of similar colours). We also 
deepened our use of GIMP, working directly on our laptops. Not only 
that, but we had an introduction to vectorising images which allowed 
us to visualize the next step in our alphabet-building process. 


Session 3 - October 15 
----------------------
% ACCORDING: Viola and Gwenael 

Some notions on ASCII art: images are replaced by text ? 128 
characters monospace, which means that all letters have the same 
pitch. If the image is crowded, all it takes is to change the 
typeface. 

Vectorisation with Inkscape: vector-based formats are made up of 
mathematical coordinates, not pixels. It's possible to have access to 
the source code of vectors in an image and also to change, at will, 
the source code. 


Session 4 - October 22 
----------------------
% ACCORDING: Adrien 

We took a look at the command line -- which provides a space for 
executing actions by typing text in a window provided for that 
purpose. This allows us to carry out actions in batches, like 
reducing the size of multiple images by inputting a single line, 
modifying a whole text, executing actions in multiple programs at 
once... Once we have that figured out, it could prove to be very 
useful and advantageous. 

Next, we had an intro to FontForge, a program for creating fonts.
We learned how to import images to make a font, modify them...
