**Where:** CulturaDigital.Br Festival, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

**What:** Brazilian free culture festival, bringing together creators and 
          community organizations.

**Best Ambience:** The festival took place almost entirely outside, on 
                   the grounds of the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro.
                   The museum itself is raised off the ground, with space
                   below. Crowds of festival-goers wandered and worked in the
                   shadow of a floating gallery.

**Best Use of Foam:** The festival's logo was rendered in giant letters, 
                      made of foam and perfect for sitting. At the end of the
                      weekend, some participants went home with parts of this
                      unusual type treatment.

**Least Expected:** For unadjusted ears, the sound of birds in nearby 
                    trees was a shock. Throughout, the constant chirps
                    accompanied the voices of happy festival participants.

**Easiest How-To:** Mimi Hui, a member of NYC Resistor took the opportunity
                    during a talk about RFID technology to explain the 
                    construction of aluminum foil Faraday cages.
