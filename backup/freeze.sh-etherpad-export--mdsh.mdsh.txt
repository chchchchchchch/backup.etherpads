Not a common _source_ viewed through different templates,
but a _source_ travelling different routes,
passing different gateways.
Current routes end at different points â€“ `.pdf`, `.html`, `.odt`.
But there are different routes, yet to be explored.

% MARKUP

> A markup language is a system for annotating a document
> in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.
> The idea and terminology evolved from the "_marking up_" of paper
> manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally
> written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.
> [@wikipedia:20150813:markup]

> Markup instructs the software that displays the text to carry out
> appropriate actions, but is omitted from the version of the text
> that users see. [@wikipedia:20150813:markup]

> Procedural markup [...] is embedded in text and provides instructions
> for programs that are to process the text. Well-known examples include
> troff, LaTeX, and PostScript. It is expected that the processor will run
> through the text from beginning to end, following the instructions as
> encountered. Text with such markup is often edited with the markup visible
> and directly manipulated by the author. Popular procedural-markup systems
> usually include programming constructs, so macros or subroutines can be
> defined and invoked by name. [@wikipedia:20150813:markup]

> The term markup is derived from the traditional publishing practice of
> "_marking up_" a manuscript, which involves adding handwritten annotations
> in the form of conventional symbolic printer's instructions in the margins
> and text of a paper manuscript or printed proof. For centuries, this task
> was done primarily by skilled typographers known as "markup men" or
> "copy markers" who marked up text to indicate what typeface, style, and
> size should be applied to each part, and then passed the manuscript to
> others for typesetting by hand. Markup was also commonly applied by editors,
> proofreaders, publishers, and graphic designers, and indeed by document authors.
