New media curator --
information architect --
theater maker --
science fiction writer --
data base programmer --
media designer or software artist:
we use computer programmers to write, read, listen, publish, edit and play.
More than often we do all these things at the same time and in connection
to each other.


But do we use software to think?

My physiotherapist used the following analogy to explain how humans use tools to
negotiate the space around their bodies:

"_If you prepare a sauce..._" she said, "_and stir it with a wooden spoon... you
will be able to feel at which moment exactly the starch starts to burn to the
bottom of the pan_".
