(MUSIC PLAYING ->
If you're feeling all right, and you think you're on
Somebody let me know
Everybody in the place put a whistle in your face
Scream it out and say, yo!
Hit it!
You don't stop the rocking rhythm that makes your fingers pop
I said hip-hop, now, thanks a lot
Come on, everybody, give me what you got
I'm going to tell you a little story about the Sugar Hill Gang
With the pow-pow boogie,
the big bang-bang.

Narrator: 
They call themselves "writers" because that's what they do.
They write their names, among other things, everywhere --
names they've been given or have chosen for themselves.
Most of all they write in and on subway trains which carry their 
names from one end of the city to the other. It's called "bombing"
and it has equally assertive counterparts in rap music and break
dancing.

Graffiti writing in New York is a vocation.
Its traditions are handed down from
one youthful generation to the next.
For some, it's art.
For most people, however, it is a plague that never ends.
A symbol that we've lost control.

----

I'm Detective Bernie Jacobs.
I, in conjunction with my partner Detective Jim McHugh,
are the crime prevention coordinators for the New York City Transit
Police Department.
Graffiti as the name itself is not an art.
Graffiti is the application of a medium to a surface.
I will show you graffiti, such as the letters on the end of that car
directly in back of me.
Is that an art form?
I don't know.
I'm not an art, crimin -- critic, but I can sure as hell tell you
that that's a crime.

----

At the Grand Concourse 149th Street station in the Bronx graffiti
writers gather at what they call, "The Writers Bench"

SE3:
They're saying that the kids run the subways, that the system is out
of control that  15- or 16-year old kids are running the system and that
graffiti is the symbol of that.

No, I ain't running the system, I'm bombing the system.
They're trying to make it look like graffiti writers break windows
and everything.

- It ain't like that.
- You know who be doin' that?

Niggers who be high when they come from school are the ones.
And it's in the graffiti artists' favor to be as cool calm and
collected about putting his art on the train as he can. You know
he wants to get in and get out without even being noticed, except for
the work that's going to come out to the public, you know, that Monday.

CES:
Yeah, we gotta start to rock some straight letters.

- This one came out all right.
- Yeah, that's the first.

That's about the third "Skeme" piece I did this year.
And that's the Tick-Tack I did in Gun Hill.
What did you do last night, man?
We did two whole cars. It was me, Dez and Mean 3.
And in the first car in small letters, it said "all you see is"
and then big block silver letters, it said

- crime in the city, right?
- It took up the whole car?

Yeah, it was a whole car and it was a scroll - like you know, one of
them scrolls?
In the next car it was a Skeme that had a cop character.
You know, a police nigger with a stick, you know, and a badge --

Barbara Andalcio:
Society should go down in the subway and lock them up, because they
don't have any business down there. It is dangerous down there. People
that work down there 25 and 30 years ... have accidents. But his
contention is that he's immortal, I guess, like most 17-year olds are 
immortal, right?

It's a matter of getting a tag on each line and each division.
You know, it's called "going all-city"
People see your tags in Queens, Uptown, Downtown  -- all over.

(laughing) 
Really, I can only laugh to keep from crying, because what happens is
that he really -- I don't really think he knows how silly that sounds.
He's going all-city.
I mean, to what end? And when I ask him he says to me,
"Well, just so people see it and they know who I am."
Nobody knows who he is and so they see it --  

No, it's not a matter of "So they know who I am."

So they see it. And after they see it, so what?

It's a matter of bombing, knowing that I can do it.
Every time I get into a train, almost every day I see my name.
I say "Yeah, you know it. I was there, I bombed it."
It's for me. It's not for nobody else to see.
I don't care  --
I don't care about nobody else seeing it, or the fact if they can
read it or not.
It's for me and other graffiti writers, that we can read it.
These other people who don't write they're excluded.
I don't care about them, you know?
They don't matter to me.
It's for us.

(starts and stops music)

rapping and breaking became the prime expressions of a new young
people's subculture called "hip-hop"
graffiti is the written word.
There is the spoken word of rap music ...
(rap music playing)
and then there's the acrobatic body language of dances like "breaking"

----

Frosty Freeze:
It started in the Bronx and part of Harlem.
It started in Freeze's house.

His mom used to break.

Don't be talking about my mother now.
Just don't talk about my mother.
Boy, you're acting stupid now.

Breaking is when you don't have nothing to do,
everybody just standing around and getting high.

You make up your own freezes.
You got names for them.

- Like what?
- Like the baby.

That's the baby.

A dead freeze, like this.

Crazy Legs:
That's one of them old -- ancient --

That ain't one of the old cause I was the first one to do it.

How ancient can you get?

- The one when you go like this?
- It's called the hump.

- The headache.
- No, that's the headache.

And the other one is the hump.

When you got a headache, you go like that, you know?

When you hump, you go like that.

----

Yo, man this place is bombed.

Iz:
This is the transit system.
They don't like it to be defaced.
They will, at times, try and ...
go to the extreme in trying to apprehend you.
The subway system is a very old one and I've personally explored some
tunnels and I've found rooms  with maps that were so old might have
been like the first train line that New York City had.
Call it what you want, it's just a lot of rock, a lot of steel,
it's a tomb, a dungeon, under the city.
Lot of trains
a lot of fun.
Lot of art.
Art that's going to be a part of New York City's history forever.

Sach:
Oh, wow! Check it out a whole car!
Check it out, man! Sach, quick.
Look at that!
A lot of writers have been down here.
You can'tell.
Graffiti all over the place.
Years ago, it was pretty much a secret.
It was secretly done. People wondered and wished they could do it.
Now, most people do it.
When all the toys are home sleeping ... cuddling to their pillows.
They usually have curfews. Come down ... in the wee hours of the
night afer the workers done their job, the sweepers did the sweeping
they had to do ...
I just take my time and be creative.

----

Dondi:
I think it's something you can never recapture again once you
experience it. You have, like, live third rails and like, crazy cops
who come and chase you out. Even the smell you get when you first
smell trains in a yard, it's like ... it's a good smell to, like, a
dedicated graffiti writer, I guess. When you're first against a train
everything seems so big, like ... wow! It's like you're
in a yard of metal giants. I mean everything is so hard, and so steel
you're just there. You're like a little dude in the midst of all this
metal and like, you're here to produce something.
Well, you're here to try to produce something. 

----

Well, I've seen comparable graffiti. Not necessarily these particular
ones. Each of these costs us a million dollars, in a sense because
others went out and tried to copy. It isnt worth it. Well, it is one
of the quality- of- life offenses. And you can't just take one of
those quality- of- life offenses; it's like three- card- monte and
pickpocketing and shoplifting and graffiti defacing our public and
private walls. They're all in the same area of destroying our
lifestyle and making it difficult to enjoy life. And I think it has
to be responded to. So I've told you the response that I think a
repeater, three-time repeater, should get would be five days in
jail. Now, obviously, a murderer, if you believe in the death penalty
as I do, you want to have the option of executing a murderer.
You wouldn't do that to a graffiti writer.

----

Man:
I saw you at work over here and I just want to find out what you're
filming. 

Interviewer: 
Were making a film on subway graffiti in New York.

Why did you take this particular neighborhood here? What's unusual?
Is there more graffiti here than other places? I hope not.

Were here because one of the best graffiti writers lives around here.
He writes "Seen"

- What is it?
- S - E - E - N.

("the Wanderer" plays)

- That's his name?
- Yes, that's what he writes.

- Or is it a nom de plume?
- It is a nom de plume.

I see. You wouldn't tell me his real name?

- No.
- Why not?

Would he get in trouble, or wouldn't he be glorified by it?

Seen:
All right, there's about four numerous reasons why ... I ain't
painting right now. To make a long story short, I'm on what they call
a six-month probation.
I call it a six-month vacation never mind probation.
Now they got a graffiti squad on this line which there really was
never, really.
Since they come on this line, it's been harder to piece. It ain't
like the old days when the train pulled into the yard on a friday
night, that train wouldn't pull out until Monday morning. Now, when
you go to piece a train, you put an outline on the train and you can
say goodbye, the train pulls out 10 minutes later. Or, if you're
ready, to put an outline you gotta chase the train down the track to
put an outline on the piece. It just ain't the same anymore.
They don't know what they're doing no more.

Late, as usual.

But I'm here. I show up, though. I show up. Let me see.

Well, why don't you do this one on that side of the wall?

- You know what I'm saying?
- These two?
- No. This one --
- It's going to be crowded.

Were going to have plenty of room.

- The bottom of the piece?
- The bottom of the piece, I say, about here.

"the United Artists" will go a little bit below the top, cause you're
going to have it on a wave.
Big letters. I want you to start from about here. Maybe even here.
Start it from here. Listen to me. From here. You understand what I'm
saying to you?

(paint spraying)

I still think it's too big.

Now, your first outline is needed, always needed. This way you know
what you're filling in. No matter how good you are, you can't just go
on in and just start filling in -- in the alr. You've got to have
your first outline. Once your first outline is done, then your fill-in,
that takes away your first outline. You don't need your first
because now you got your fill-in. From your fill- in, you put your
colors and then your 3-D. If you want background, you put your cloud
or whatever. 

How's this, Nick?
I'm throwing a few connections here.
I'm going to make it look like yours.
What do you think?
I'll make a few bits.

All right. Huh?

Bits. Bits. I don't know.
Little doodads here and there.
Yeah, now it's shaping up.
I have about a hundred outlines
but I've shaped it up.

Nicky, Nicky, come on!
You gonna save me room or what?
I didnt do that to yours. Get out of there! Go on!

----  

Barbara Andalcio:
He's making a mess in this house. He cannot sit down without you
know, doing graffiti on something.

- All right
- He really can't.

When you're talking on the phone, you don't doodle on the paper?

- I don't doodle.
- Yes, you do.
- I do not doodle.
- You do doodle on the paper. 

I just write my name while I'm talking on the phone.
What's that?
I'm just writing something.
You're telling me that you write your name while
you're talking on the phone.
In the meantime you have destroyed your room.

- You have destroyed your room.
- Testing out my paints.

You have no respect for anything.
Don't tell me about testing out your paints.

----  

Ain't we putting red, yellow, or red, orange and yellow here?

No, the browns got to be brown.
I ain't putting no browns there.
Ain't no way.

Red, orange and yellow.
You want it to stand out.

The whole thing. Around the whole works -- Red, orange, yellow.
Remember how I did the "Mad Seen" with the wall and the color
went all around the thing? The "Mad Seen" the one on the 5s?
With the walls all falling down. The one I did myseIf.

- No.
- All right.

Let me explain.
Yellow, orange and a little bit of red -- yellow and orange around
the whole thing and then, we'll put browns and beiges in the 3-D.
Believe me. I'll show you.
Not around the fade. Fade into the yellow, but a trim
over it -- a cheap trim. I'll show you after. I'll show you after.
all right? I'll never steer you wrong, Nick.

Rustoleum, Krylon,
Wet-look,
Epoxy, Red Devil ...

When you hold a can of Rustoleum in your hand, it's like holding
three other shit brands in your hand. It lasts , it covers and it's
not aerosol like Krylon. It just comes out in a mist.
This comes out like paint.

Mayor Koch:
The schools have courses in art. How about the mothers and fathers of
this city saying to the kids, "that's the wrong thing to do"?

----

You listen to them talk they sound ridiculous.

He's king of the yakkety-yak yard.
Who died and left him king of any yard?
He owns nothing in the subway, you know?
(laughs)

----

I love robbing paint. I know, you know, everybody knows how you rob
it. He gets me souped up and sometimes I'll go and get 15 cans at a
time, you know. Stuffing it in your coat, in your shirt, down the
back of your pants. It's mainly with the big coat and like 15 cans
you figure it out, it's like over $50. you're going into stores --
we could go one day and get 100 cans at a time. It's easy. For me,
anyway. It's harder on black kids or Spanish kids, cause everybody
thinks a graffiti writer is black and Puerto Rican and that's, you
know, it's wrong. A lot of white people are writin'.

----

What youve got is a whole miserable subculture.

----

Zephyr:
I was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. I went to a sort of
strict prep school in the Bronx, right? Riverdale Country School. In
attending that school, I had to walk past the 1 yard on 242nd Street
every day. From where I stood, I'd watch the trains pull in and out.
I thought, "How could a human being have his name on every car?" You
know, that these guys must either live in there, be allowed to live in
there or just be ... allowed to go on like that, right? They're
trespassing it; They're beating the system; They're getting their
names up, right? We've drenched the city with our names, right?
Were trying our damndest.

We caught a freshly painted "Double-R" and
we spent about three hours in it.

- That's impossible.
- No, it's not.

We were tagging with the "Unis", then the "Minis" then the "Marvies"
then the "Pilots" then the "Flowpens" and we were doing clouds around
the tags and 3-Ds on the tags -- for the Double-Rs to have a clean
car back then it was ... we just had an orgasm.

Narrator:
1970 --

the idea of getting your name up,
not just in your neighborhood,
but everywhere,
was invented by a kid named Taki
who lived on 183rd Street in Washington Heights.

Taki 183.

As soon as everybody understood that it was a name
they realized that Taki was famous.

----

Wasp:
Taki 183 was the first guy.
Even though they say Julio 204 started before him.
But he was the one who made it famous.
Then, after him, in them times it was Papo 184.
Then came out Junior 161
Cay 161, they were bombing, too.
Stitch came out around 1971. He was all-city, too.
Barbara, Eva 62, they were girls.

Everybody was writing.
That was what everybody was talking in them days.

I got into graffiti, just like riding the trains, when I was younger.
You know, looking at the old writers' shit, you know? A lot of new
writers around you talk to them about a lot of old writers they don't
know what you're talking about.

----

I started, in 1973 or 1974 during very ... early years ... of initial
bombing, very important years of graffiti bombing. If it wasnt for
those years, I don't think we would get where we are today. That was
the life back then. That was happening. Everybody was pioneering back
then. That's when all
your developing happened -- your bubble letters, all that kind of
stuff. Your wild styles.

----

(MUSIC PLAYING ->

Crash:
The wild styles.

Noc:
You don't have to do
straight letters to have style.
Anything that comes in your imagination
adds onto your own individual style.

The arrow.

Everybody's got their own arrow.

I like that, though.

Various arrow some guys have on-the-letter arrow -- that was like
connection. Some people had different arrows just going right
through their pieces.

Colors, designs, style,
technical advanced...

- Get loose.
- Get loose.

Cartoons, everything.

And when they see you got a vicious style, they be wanting to get
loose about it, and that's what keep it going.

- That's what sparks graffiti.
- Keep sparkin' it.

----

You know, I know a lot of good writers, and all the writers that I
knew they used to get up, so they used to tell me,
"Trap, why don't you get up?"
And I started getting up with them we started doing pieces.
Then I met Dez --

One day, I came to the Bench and I seen him sitting there, looking at
the pieces. You could tell a writer you know? You go to the Bench and
you see him as the trains go by, he be going like this, you know,
he have ink stains on his clothes.

He gave me outlines and stuff to practice --

I can't let him go for at least five minutes or he'll destroy the
piece. You know? I turn around
"Trap, what you doing?"

"I want to do my own piece."

I said "Yeah , but, you know, follow the outline."

Russ, Russ!

What's up, man?

You know it.
Chillin', man!

Slick Rick!
Slick Rick!

And the Acey Base!

for about two and a half years I was upstate from like the beginning
of 1970 to 72.

What's up?
Hey, what's up?

When I came home I ain't know nothing about no writing, no graffiti,
cause I wasn't about it.
All right, you know it.

What's up, man?

So, when I got home, I seen writing on the train. I said "What's this
stuff here? Those niggers doing their names big." said "Let me do one
at least." cause I was down with art already. And I did me a piece
for people in general to get to know who I am. I said "Oh, that
look's all right. I'm'a go every Sunday now." Next thing I know, I
started getting better and better.And as I realized I knew to get
better, I said "Oh, man I'm going to bring out the computer rock."
And then that's when I really got loose, cause then niggers was
saying,
"Yo, who's that guy?"
Then one day, these news reporters people was on train station -- we
was going by and we seen them. We seen them filming our whole car.
We went up to them, and I remember, I said
"Who you think probably done that right there?"
Just to be curious to see what they'd say.
And they say
"I don't know, but whoever done it that's remarkable talent.
I ain't never seen nothing like this before."
I said
"If I told you I did it, would you believe me?"
He say
"I don't know. I can't say, but I believe so cause you don't know
what you can believe these days."
I said
"I did."
And then he said
"I don't believe that. You only got one arm."
I said
"that don't mean nothing. I do things that people don't realize I can
do with this. Being that I'm like this, you know?"
And then he said
"I hear you there, sonny."
And I say,
"I ain't no sonny. I just was asking you a question, sir, that's all
I wanted to know to see your feelings about it."

Kase:
Well, I know one thing about graffiti, man.
Niggers say it played out, niggers say this, niggers say that.
But, it's going to keep going on. Cause I might be old and quit,
but you coming up,
younger niggers is coming up, it's going to keep going and keep
going, you know?
cause you going to be a king soon, too, you know?

Dez:
He's like a son to me in a way, you know. I look out for him and he
looks out for me. I won't let nothing happen to him, you know? He
won't let nothing happen to me if he could help it. I know for his
age, he's 14 now and I'm 16. About the time he get my age, he be one
of the best people out. If he continues to go on in the years, he can
be another Picasso.

The idea of style and competing for the best style

Lennie Len:
right now, he's doing the footwork when original breaking came out.

There he's doing the baby
and the turtle.

- The back bridge.
- Yeah.

He did the head spin and then just went up.

I got a certain backspin that I made up. Want me to show you it?
I started of doing like this ... and landing like that.
So, then, I just ... decided not to do the freeze and keep on
spinning.
So it goes like this.
I put my arm right here and it's easy.
And I push my arm and swing my left leg -- my right leg --
both of em around.

Other crews, They're not as good as us,
cause we have the breaking form.

- Crazy Legs: Original style.
- Yeah, original style.

Other crews like "Dynamic Rockers"

- they bite, usually --
- Yeah, they bite!

Let me tell you about these people, Dynamic Rockers.

MC:
One- two- one- two.
One- two- one.
Party people in the place!

Rock Steady against Dynamic Rockers!

Rock on till the break of dawn!

Crazy Legs in the house!

Crazy Legs:
This goes back ... when I used to go to the roller-skating rink,
United Skates of America in Queens, right? I used to go
over there to break against all of them and take them all out. You
know, burn em make em look stupid. And they had no kind of style at
all. They was beginners. I been breaking way before them.

MC:
(MUSIC PLAYING ->
A-Rock-on the kid
the Crazy Legs...

Frosty Freeze:
We started doing better routines than they were. They got to a point
where they got mad at us because we was taking them out with our
moves. Then, that started getting out of hand, because they had the
crowd and we didnt.

MC:
Yo! Whoever ain't in Rock Steady or Dynamic, get behind the barriers!
Yo! Both rockin' crews can you please listen? Nobody's listening to
me. Were not going to start until you move.
Rockers, get ready.

(music playing)

Frosty Freeze:
Up-Rock is just like humillating. Doing things in peoples' faces and
all that. And down-Rocking, as you know, is trying to see who can
compete against whose moves on the floor.

MC rapping:
I was lookin' out
on the 33rd floor
ln of the sudden
there was a knock on my'door
It was "Son of Sam"
with a 44
He blew a hole
straight through my door
So I went to the back
to get the gun
I was out two bullets
had only one
I shoot the shit
I shot him in his eye
Never saw a white man
jump so high.

MC:
So who won the rocking contest?

(crowd chants)
Rock Steady! Rock Steady!

You all know who took them out right? Put it this way, were out of
sight and they bite.
They bit my turtle into a hop -- Oh, man. I could've cried when I
seen that. You know, that faggot that was flying around there with
his funny legs and shit?

- He's in gymnastics.
- So what? So what?

That's not even breaking.
That's all falry flying.
I call that falry flying.

MC:
Who goes for Rock Steady?

(crowd cheering)

The Dynamic Rockers?

(heightened cheering)

Hold it. Hold it down.

It was a tie.
It was a tie.

Woman: 
How do you fill up a train like that? You can't do it overnight.
Do you wait for the same train coming back into the same station?

No, you get the parked train, and you just --

- Oh, you mean you go to the subway yard.
- Yeah.

Does your mother wonder why you come home with that all over your face? 

No, she knows I write the graffiti. I told her I say I'm going up on
the trains. I'm gonna go write some graffiti.

- Does she worry you might get caught?
- Yeah.

She says "If the cops call, Don't come running to me."

Um ...
I never realized it meant so much to them. I just thought they were
writing ... just writing anything. But I guess it has a deep meaning.

- Huh?
- What kind of deep meaning?

Well, like he said ... he's writing his girlfriends' name.

He's Dust whatever that means.

What is Dust supposed to mean?

It's just a name.
It's a word, you know.
See, it's a game.
They give you a name,
and they say,
"Here, take this name and do something with it."
Like, he got the name Seen.
He can walk around, just say,
"My name is Seen,"
and say,
"Yeah, I seen that there. I seen it there."

It's a name.
It's just like ...
I'll give you a name and you say,
"How big could you get this name up? How high?"

----

(train noise) 

Trains are routinely washed, but because of the graffiti problem, we
have to use a graffiti removal solution, which, at best is
detrimental to the physical make- up of the train itseIf.
This is what I'm assigned. The car wash.

8:00 a.m., Jamaica Yard.
Hold your nose.

Detective Jacobs:
We spend a lot of money replacing broken and damaged side windows.
We cannot use ... acrylic plastic windows in the train because the same
graffiti removal solution fogs the windows.

Richard Ravitch: 
The problem often is, that often it doesn't produce a sparkling clean
car, but rather a sort of vomitous color which some of the graffiti
artists argue is less attractive than what they consider to be their
artwork. So, it's alltogether sort of an unsatisfactory result.

Motorman: 
Watch out. You might get wet now. Watch your shoes. It's not the best
smelling stuff, but so far it hasn't hurt me. You know it hasn't
bothered me. Some fellows, it bothers.

(motorman coughs)

That's my money that's being diverted from providing me with good,
safe, secure rapid transit.

----

Look at this junk. graffiti doesn't make your life better;
it just makes your neighborhood look worse.
You know how I made something out of my life?

- By using my hands.
- But only in the ring.

Don't use them to mess up the walls with graffiti.

I've practiced all my life to make moves like that.
And I worked every day to be a singer.
So, if you really want to make something out of your life,

- Use your head.
- Or your voice.

But don't waste your time making a mess.

Harold Levine:

Make your mark in society, not on society.

This happens to be a poster that is ... the first in a series. It's
going to be used in New York City's, subways and buses where we've
used Hector Camacho who's a boxer North American lightweight champ,
and Alex Ramos, boxer leading middleweight contender.

"take it from the champs,
graffiti is for chumps.
Make your mark in society,
not on society."

----

It's really very clever.

"Put your mark on society, in doing something in society."

I've screwed it up a little bit but, nevertheless you got the message.

Reporter:
Realistically, do you think it will work?

You say realistically,
I'm hopeful that it will work.
Nobody thought that we would be as successful as we were in the
campaign against the drought and water conservation; nevertheless,
that worked. I'm hopeful we will have equal success here.
Time will tell.

Mr. Mayor,  
are those posters graffiti-proof?

Time will tell.

(laughter)

----

What you doing, B?
Fresh?

- It's fresh.
- One of my little signature series.

Word. Lord, you getting fresh on a nigger, man.
That nigger's still got the touch, boy.
Butchy-butch, with the tiger skin!

I see you did the "Kase" with a "c" this time.

Yeah, he know who I am though, anyway.

The king of what?
The king of style.

Sure, I got styles already that's more complex that nobody know
about. I mean super- duty tough work. See, this is just semi- like,
what I would call it. But, if I really get into it and start
camouflaging it, I don't think you even be able to read it.

(MUSIC PLAYING ->
don't go nowhere...

Throw a little semi thing here.
It wasnt no severely bad accident, just that I got burnt by wires,
that's all. A long time ago. Electrical wires. And then they rushed
me to the hospital and they just had to amputate, cause my tissues
and muscles was burnt bad. And I was young, I was playing and I
wasnt, you know, too sure - I knew what I was doing, but I just didn't
know should I grab the wire or not, I don't know if I grabbed it or
not, but I know I just, you know, got hurt.
cause it had knocked me out so I didnt remember. But that don't mean
nothing in general. I'm okay. It's just, that was a bad thing to
happen at the time. But that's why people are amazed about me now
cause of going through that, and then deallng with what I'm deallng
with, even though it's common littery bull- crap in a way. People
look at a person, "What, you write on trains? Oh, you vandalism,"
and all that. Yeah, I vandalism. all right. But still, in general,
I know what I'm doing. I did something to make your eyes open up,
right? So why are you talking about it for?

----

(slow Latin funk music playing) 

Cap:
from here up ...
nobody goes but me.
It's my lay-ups.
Definitely.
Cause this is a beautiful spot to do pieces on.
Ain't hardly no writers know about this place.
My spot.
Niggers know. Believe it. niggers know. Heh-heh-heh.
Yo. Here.
Take the cans.

I am not a graffiti artist.
I'm a graffiti bomber.
There's two styles of graffiti that are trying to, you know,
co-exist with each other.
But it ain't gonna work like that.

Blood wars, buddy.
Blood wars.

----

Min:
That's why graffiti is ruined.

That Cap ruined the 2s and 5s. The 2s and 5s used to go to the 2 yard.
It would be a masterpiece art gallery of burners from all these dudes
from the Bronx and Brooklyn with def wild styles. Now you go to the 2
yard, it's all destroyed. This guy named Cap with his Lucille Ball
halrdo is going over all your burners.

Hey, what's up, Shy?
I've seen your new pieces on the 2s and 5s.

They went over that.

- That Shy-Min.
- Yeah, I know.

- Cap.
- Cap.

I wouldn't have minded if he would've went over one of my old cars,
but that was fresh. It was a brand new burner. It only ran for two
days, you know? He didnt give it a chance to run on the line.
Just like ... pow!
They went over it, and now I feel ... that hurt me, you know?

And Seen was with him and PJ and then I called Seen up and he denied it. 

----

I can't afford to get involved. There's a war going on, as you should
know...
PJ and Cap -- against everybody.
He just crossed me out anyway. I don't know why.
Brand new car, too he wasted.
Let's say this, I stand behind them if they had a good cause for the
situation. As far as it is now ... they have no cause behind it.
They're just doing it for the hell of it ... which that ain't me
because I wouldn't'want people to go over my pieces, so I wouldn't go
over them.

----

Shy : 
He's disrespecting the line which no other guy was doing that years
ago. All he does is silver throw-ups.

You got fresh colored pieces, full top-to-bottoms.

And he'll just laugh at you.
"It's just a throw-up. I've got a million of em running"

He's a jealous toy, that's all, cause he can't do a burner.

- He can't do shit.
- He can't even do a straight letter.
- He went over this?
- Yeah.
- He did a Cap up over me and a MPC over this and wrote war next to
  Fat Albert.
- Oh, shit.
- You can't never make up for that.
- That's never forgive action.
- If you're a toy, you gotta be stopped.
- This guy's a toy and he's big and he's still gotta be stopped.
- Gotta break his arms.
- But how come we walted all this long?

How come there's so many writers that he went over and were not in
his neighborhood with crews?

Because nobody wants to get united.

We gotta get together, bro'.

Everybody that says, "Were gonna get down, right?"

But nobody comes, man.

What we gotta do is meet everybody on 149th Street at the Bench. At
the Grand Concourse. We should forget our bullshit worries that we
got with each other, unite and get this toy, cause he's dogging
everybody...

(echoes)
... everybody.

----  

Cap, I don't know, some big white boy.

I don't know him, I don't want to know'him.

Yeah, that's why he's doing.

He's trying to get attention and revenge, cause people go over his
throw-ups. People who do burners -- you see a throw-up, you're going
to go over it. Who thinks Cap's throw-ups are worth being on a train?

(together)
Nobody!

Pistol:
- What you write, bro'?

I write Mare, man.

- Mear, M-E-A-R?

M-A-R-E.

- M-A-R-E, Mar?

Yeah.
Mare.
Mar is M-A-R.

But no, seriously, you gotta kill them dudes for doing that.

Who's Cap?
Cap is right here?

(together)
No!

----

Cap:
People don't know what I look like until now.
Till they start going to the movies. they're going to see my face.
Big deal.
Anybody tries to screw around with me and my friends,
I go over everything they got forever.
Everybody,
from Brooklyn to Manhattan.
Everybody.
And that's the way it is.
Especially with me.
The object is more.
Not the biggest and the beautifullest but more.
It' s like a little piece on every car ... is what counts. Not one
whole car on every 30 cars that goes by. Once you start going over
someone, you can't stop. So, I'm gonna live. Dust started pulling
some shit with me. I'm telling you , he's lucky we didnt catch him by
that wall. If we would've been there even if you was shooting the
movie it would've just been boom-boom-boom!
And that's the way it would've went.

----

It's gonna get crossed out,
I guarantee, by tomorrow, once they find out it's here.

Help me with the 3-D, Nicky.
Come on.

The piece has got a lot of colors to go in there yet.
But with the color we could do that with no problem.
I could do it before it gets dark.
No problem.
Colors, colors, colors!

----

Cap:
That was a beautifull wall.
I really liked that.
People like that, they deserve getting everything they got crossed out ...
forever.

----

Man:
For the past 20 years, there really hasn't been anything hot. There
have been no movements since Pop Art. Any retaller, and let's face it
a gallery is indeed a retaller They're always looking for something
hot that they can merchandise and sell to the public. It's almost as
though these pieces were peeled of the train and put onto canvas, so
you have the same energy, you have the same coloring, you have the
same intensity and the same big piece that you would see on a train.
The real subway graffiti that's done on the trains is slowly dying
out, and this is taking its place. The lifespan of an average piece
today only lasts a few months. This is something that could last a
lifetime.

Woman:
"Blondie" seems to be an important figure within the graffiti art
style. Calne has used her in a very photographic way.
Noc, shows her ... expressionistically.

I'm a colorist myself.
I'm an artist.
And it's exciting.
The color is exciting, the movement is exciting.
It combines all kinds of movement.

Man:
We had ABC-TV. We had CBS here tonight.
Were going to be on the news tonight at 11:00.
National Public Radio.

----

Do it up, baby.

I love it.

I'm Ron Powers.
I'm a reporter with the Associated Press.

- How long would it take you to do something like this?
- On a train?

Depends on what your schedule is.
I can't let my mother know that I'm going to the trains, so I have to
be back early.

Woman:
But I did meet a guy here who's an art critic from the news and he
says he gets so goddamn mad every time he sees this, that he walked
up to one of the artist at the show tonight and said

"How would you feel if I took a can and wrote on your graffiti?"

And the artist said to him
"I kill you, man."

As an investment I feel so strongly that if you get in on the bottom
of anything, it's got to be a good investment. This is definitely
going someplace. But I think that graffiti on the subway cars were a
symbol of New York for foreign people, especially French people. And
I think it's a little sad if graffiti is going to be only on Canvas
and not anymore on trains.

Forget about the trains.
Who wants to be dirty and hot at the same time?
That's right. I'm into making money.
It feels good.
You go to school and the teacher says,
"It's not worth anything. You don't make any money from graffiti."
And you tell them,
"When was the last time you made $2,000 in a month, huh?"
And you go
"Okay, now you falled"

----

All right, the thought has crossed my mind, if something should
happen, I'll go along with it, but if it doesn't it's no thing to me,
because that's not what I'm out here for.
I'm out here to bomb, period. That's what I started for.
I didnt start writing to go Paris.
I didnt start writing to do canvases.
I started writing to bomb.
To destroy all lines.

That's what I'm doing.

- How long do you think you'll do it?

Till I'm finished.

- Now that you've heard that, you understand what I'm saying to you when
  I say I don't understand him. He's out there to bomb, destroy all lines. 

  What have the lines ever done to him?

They made me pay 75¢.

- When do you pay 75¢?

Never but --

- I don't even know what you're talking about.

Consider us

Woman: 
I think it's about time the politicians came down and looked and saw  
what is on these trains. It is just awful. It shouldnt be that way. 

It should be cleaned and the ones that are caught, they should clean  
it -- the ones they catch doing that. 

What's the sense of paying 75¢ when you have to ride graffiti trains,  
you know? 

It gives a terrible impression of the city. And if you think the  
outside is bad -- I've been riding them, like I say, for 40 years --  
the inside is just unbelievable. 

It's a violation of public property. 

I think it's disgusting. 
They should get somebody to clean up the place. 

----  

We move three and a half million people a day. They have rights, too. 
(train screeching to stop) 
The people see the outside of the cars when the trains are going --  
pull into the station, or when they're passing on the express track.  
And then it's generally a blur. But I don't think the public finds  
that nearIy as intrusive and ugly as they do the inside graffiti. 

- He hates the insides. 
- Yeah, he hates the insides. 

He said if there's any possible way of we giving him some kind of  
suggestion of how 
to get rid of the inside, he said there might be a chance of  
"negogiading" with the outside. 

- "Negogiading?" 
- Something like that. 

I met with a group of them one day. More out of intellectual  
curiosity as to who they were and what made them tick. I found them  
surprisingly articulate. They expressed a strong sense that if their  
outside paintings were let untouched that the public would be  
impressed. 

We came up to him with a proposal to paint 10 cars inside and out and  
let it run in the major stations. And let people vote on it, let's  
say a two- week period, and after the two- week period, they'll have  
the resuIts in the paper, and I think the MTA will be embarrassed. I  
thought there was no basis whatsoever in which it was proper for  
anyone to touch our property in an unauthorized fashion.  

They got guys out there that are mugging people in the subways,  
stabbing people, throwing people onto the tracks and all that and  
they're wasting their bullshit money trying to get us. 

With all respect, I think you are close to falling into the trap of  
the 1960s culture which says this society has left these kids with  
not enough to do. If the kids have energy and want to do something,  
we'll give them all brooms, we'll give them all sponges, and they can  
do something that is publicly productive, useful and that would earn  
for them the respect and approbation of their fellow citizens. It  
isnt the energy that is misplaced, it's the value system that is  
misplaced. 

----  

(Wagnerian orchestral music plays) 

I think it's great for the riding public to be up on the station, one  
cold and dreary day and see a nice white shiny car come pulling up to  
the station. The public has knocked us for so long, that we are doing  
nothing. It couldnt be done. We proved that we done it. We painted  
409 cars in approximately eight weeks. 24 hours a day, seven days a  
week and not one day did we miss that production schedule.  Our  
personal pride was hurt. A lot of people been knocking the transit  
authority, and we wanted to show them that we could do something. If  
the Japanese can do it, we can do it. 

----  

Man : 
The stuff is like razor blades -- about two inches long and there's  
one of these every two inches. There's really not too much protective  
clothing you can wear to prevent yourself from getting cut. And once  
you do fall into it, it's so structured that it collapses upon you  
and the more you try to move, the worse off you become. It's like in  
the movies like in "Apocalypse Now" they used it 
to protect their lines and their barricades. they want to hold back  
the enemy from destroying 
our trains. 

----  

Mayor Koch: 
About three years ago, I decided to suggest to Dick Ravitch that they  
put a dog in the yard to keep the graffiti vandals out. The MTA  
rejected it and they said, no, that if you put a dog in the yard, the  
dog would step on the third rail. Now, I don't happen to think that  
dogs step on the third rail but I said in response to that "If you  
think the dog will step on the third rail, then build two fences and  
have the dog run between the two fences and that will keep people out  
and protect the dog from stepping on the third rail." And the  
response was,  
"Maybe somebody will climb over the fence and the dog will bite them." 
I said "I thought that was what the dog was for." 
But if you're afrald of having the dog bite such a vandal, and here I  
called upon my prodigious memory, I said,  
"What you should do then, instead of using a dog, is to use a woIf  
and have a wolf run between the two fences. Because there is no  
recorded case in history where a wolf has ever attacked a human being  
unless the woIf were rabid  -- mad." 
As a resuIt of telling that story innumerable times I embarrassed the  
MTA into building the fence  around the first of 19 yards.  
And it was so successful they now claim itas their own idea and they're  
building 18 more fences. 

----  

(Wagnerian orchestral music plays)

Iz:
I think it's stupid. The idea of having all this barbed wire and  
fences and protection. 
trains are still going to get written on. 
They invented the white elephant. 
It's still got -- Well, they weren't bombed, but they had little  
mosquito bites. call it what you want. They were still written on.  
They're still not spotless, completely.

"Dump Koch"
Well, there you go.
That is the highest praise imaginable because,
obviously, I'm getting to them.

There always will be graffiti. 
It's a part of New York. 
It'll be there forever. 
Someone will always want to jump down on the track, or while the  
train's moving and just take out a can of paint or a marker and put  
up their initial.

He still shows me all his things, which I don't even want to see. But  
we still talk. He tells me just about everything that goes on. Other  
than that I wouldn't really be able to tell you so much. And,  
sometimes -- knowing all this, it just really only makes me that much  
more fearful for him. 

I felt that I just had to let her know cause sometimes when it's time  
to go bombing, you got to go late -- in the middle of the night.  
Youve got to leave the house at 2:00 just to go bombing so you don't  
get caught. You know, she got to know where I'm going, can't just say  
I'm going to a party. No party's going to start at 2:00. 

Not every kid would tell his mother where he's going. 

Yeah, well, I'd rather let my mother know what's going on, you know,  
than keep her in the dark. If I get busted , cops call, "excuse me we  
have your son for graffiti." And I'd rather let her know that I was  
doing it so she's prepared to come and get me out. 
But, I'm never getting busted , so we don't have to worry about that.

I mean, an adult 
I just couldn't see an aduIt ever putting that much energy into  
something that isn't going to pay, or is going to risk their lifeor  
have the possibility of them getting arrested.

I see myseIf eventually growing out of graf and getting married and  
living the lifestyle, you know, and making good money, like that. And  
when life is at its best you don't really want to run around in the  
trains. I'm sure I'll come back every now and then, just to let  
people know I'm still around. Oh, no. When I come back I take over.  
And that's it. after that. 

- And after that --  
- You want the prince of the 6s? 

I'm king right here. 
I'm the prince of the 6s. 

He's later. You know he's one of the has-beens --  

I'm what they call a has-been, and he's a wannabe. 

Wannabe?

- So they consider you a king? 
- Put it this way: 

I am a king. I could say --  
King of what? 
I want to tell you,  
I am the king of bombing. 
You got to be able to take over a line with insides take it over with  
throw-ups, top-to-bottoms, you got to do everything. If you  
speciallze in one thing, you really can't call yourseIf an all-out  
king. 

----
