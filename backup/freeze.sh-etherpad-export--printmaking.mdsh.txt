Contemporary Printmaking?

% LUDOVICO: POST-DIGITAL PRINT

%> As an electronic musician, Cascone was about a decade ahead of his time.
%> Music – with its historical (even ancient) ties to mathematics and
%> computation, and its pioneering use of electronic media (from radio to MP3) –
%> has always been the first art form to adapt to new information technologies.

> Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing, normally on paper.
> Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an
> element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction
> of a painting.
> [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaking)

> Except in the case of monotyping, the process is capable of producing multiples
> of a same piece, which is called a print. Each print produced is not considered
> a "copy" but rather is considered  an "original". This is because typically each
> print varies to an extent  due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process,
> and also because  the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction
> of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be
> expressed in a particular printmaking technique.
> [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaking)

> Printmaking is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions,
> but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends
> itself to. [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaking)


% Not as in anachronistic desire for ink and letterpress (_at least not 100%_).
% More as in banal longing for self-re-empowerment. Maybe that's anachronistic in itself.

% keep it low profile. not design, not publishing but _making prints_.

% '_Druckgrafik_'

% a focus on technology in practise.
% technology as in 'by no means neutral',
% technology as matter to engage with.

% make things public

% printmaking as in inscription technology


> On September 18 at 6pm GMT the most awaited software of 2013, iOS7, was released.
> Amongst a sleuth of functionality change, this version of iOS is probably best known
> for its flat, colourful visual style and the more unified approach to the UI design.
> More than ever, the visual look and feel of the native UI and that of third party
> apps are more visually cohesive, meaning a better overall experience for the user.
> More cohesion, less individualism. [@woods:2013:artdesignbreakup]

> As visual design moves towards a more uniform approach that harks back to the
> Modernist era, are visual designers now more akin to engineers than graphic artists?
