% TITLE: Freed fonts, strong web
% BY: Dave Crossland
% RUBRIK: Type Design

% PULLQUOTE: "The web is about to become as typographically powerful as the latest proprietary desktop publishing applications."

Fonts are essential to the design of every web page, and true web 
fonts are about to bring the typographic sophistication of print to 
the web in force.

It’s taken a while. In 1998, Internet Explorer 4 implemented the 
feature with a DRM font format, Embedded OpenType (EOT), because it 
was part of CSS2. Despite that fact, it was ignored for years by 
other browsers until CSS co-founder Håkon Wium Lie championed it 10 
years later. Slowly all the other big browsers began to support 
regular TrueType fonts, and resisted pressure to implement a 
standardised DRM format. Today SVG Fonts are used in iPhones, 
Internet Explorer 9 supports TrueType fonts, and Libre tools do EOT 
conversions. Web fonts work everywhere.

In May, Google launched the first font service providing only Libre 
fonts. The blog for the service (http://googlewebfonts.blogspot.com) 
recently revealed some details about its growth - nearly 500,000 
domains showing web fonts to 17 million people a day.

In 2011, CSS3 will take web fonts beyond the simple font linking 
feature of 1998. Designers will finally be able to use the full power 
of OpenType fonts directly in webpages. This can be tested today with 
Firefox 4 beta releases. 

<strong>The web is about to become as typographically powerful as the 
latest proprietary desktop publishing applications.</strong> This 
means that web designers should now take time to learn about how 
typefaces vary and what those variations mean for readers -there will 
be a lot of libre fonts to choose from, and we should choose fonts 
wisely.

Three kinds of font classification schemes are useful to guide 
designers in their choices. 

1. **Simple Categories.** These are are deceptively simple. The 
deception is their “Other" categories. CSS itself has a very simple 
scheme (Serif, Sans-Serif, Fantasy, Mono) and this is useful because 
everyone can remember its groups. Contrast that with the ‘IBM 
Family’ scheme which uses a long list of historical genres and many 
“Miscellaneous" caverns.

2. **Parametric systems.** Common forms of the elements of the 
Latin alphabet are described and related. The result allows users to 
drill down into a font collection interactively: “Letters that 
wide, serifs this thick, an axis of contrast at that angle." 
PANOSE’s second version was a sophisticated example that has sadly 
disappeared thanks to an acquisition by and merger with Hewlett 
Packard. 

3. **Tagging.**  Just as we tag photographs in centralised 
proprietary photo storage services, font can be tagged. I imagine 
that eventually a de-centralised federated font classification 
network service will be made, perhaps building on the Libre-licensed 
Typedia.org project. While the first two have their place in learning 
how fonts are different, tagging is for me the most useful 
classification technique when deciding on a font.

The words people tag with are often not the words used by other 
schemes. Instead, people relate to fonts with what Ovink described in 
1938 as atmosphere values: "Those properties by which [a font] 
excites feelings within the reader." 

Curiously, Ovink found in his research that general readers can't 
tell the difference in atmosphere values of two typefaces which are 
very similar. I might suggest that this means designing new type is, 
for practical purposes, entirely pointless. 

Most importantly, he concluded that picking the "wrong" font is a 
"missed... opportunity to intensify the force of impression of the 
text in a considerable degree."


To web designers choosing web fonts, watch out. 


% B1: Today, web fonts are most useful at large sizes where 
% B1: the rendering problems associated with hinting do not occur, where 
% B1: images of text are common. Since the beginning of the web, a lot of 
% B1: large-size text on webpages has _not_ been typeset in 
% B1: overly-familiar system fonts. Instead, headlines are frozen into 
% B1: static images. This can be only just accessible at best. Today, the 
% B1: accessibility of the web impacts everyone because it defines our 
% B1: ability to machine-translate the webs of other language cultures.
