***The Libre Graphics Research Unit is a traveling lab where new ideas
for creative tools are developed. Its diverse activities range from the
practical to the theoretical via writing, research meetings,
experimental prototyping, a conference and a workshop. The Research Unit
is an initiative of four European media-labs actively engaged in
Free/Libre and Open Source Software and Free Culture. This
cross-disciplinary project involves artists, designers and programmers
and is developed in dialogue with the Libre Graphics community.***

***What future practices can we imagine,
and which tools can make them happen?***

The Libre Graphics Research Unit is a two year project aiming to:

- Bring artists, designers, F/LOSS developers and standards engineers
  around the same table to exchange ideas and share experiences.
- Develop research that inspires innovative ideas about digital tools
  and future artistic practice.
- Provide platform to artists and designers to engage in the
  construction of tools and standards that matter to them.


Motivation
----------

**Tools shape practice**
Contemporary creative work depends largely on digital tools.
These tools are cultural objects themselves,
and constitute a vital part of creative practice.
Because digital tools often suffer from overdetermined functionality
and are full of conventions about the way things "ought" to be done,
it is important that practitioners take part in their construction.
Unavoidably shaped by conventional models of production and distribution,
tools condition creative practice in terms of divisions of labour,
vocabulary and medium.

**Free, Libre and Open source Software**
The proposal of the Free, Libre and Open Source Software movement (F/LOSS)
to make source code available under a Free license, interests us at many levels.
First of all we find important the principle that both producers and users
of software have the right to read, change, distribute and alter the code.
To us, securing free knowledge exchange is a prerequisite
for any form of innovation.
Secondly, the availability of source code allows us to both learn from
and take part in the social construction of software.
Last but not least, we are inspired by the lively culture of
collaborative development that grew out of this radical proposition.
It sparked the creation of new tools informed by a new type of work:
social software (wiki),
versioning systems for collaborative software development (GIT, SVN),
secure and reliable web applications (Apache)
and various programming languages (php, python).

**Practice shapes tools**
In recent years, the Libre Graphics community provided us with
Gimp (raster-image editing),
Scribus (page-layout) and
Inkscape (vector editing),
quickly maturing Libre alternatives for
Adobe Photoshop,
Adobe InDesign and
Adobe Illustrator.
But to who are those tools fitting?
And to what job?
Joseph Weizenbaum explains that it is the iterative process
by which practice and tool inform each other,
that makes possible an imagining of the unimaginable:
"_Only rarely, if indeed ever, are a tool and an altogether original
job it is to do, invented together_"[@weizenbaum:1976:cpahr].
So, while we are grateful for the existence of credible Libre applications,
we think that replacing proprietary tools by F/LOSS does not do justice
to the possibilities opening up.

**Hybridization not homogenization**
Because of the availability of source code,
F/LOSS tools are virtually polymorphic:
they welcome divergence, alteration and exchange.
Our enthusiasm for these characteristics links to a history of
art filled with creative collaborations of many sorts.
We can also see a long tradition of artists re-inventing their tools.
The growing popularity of generative tools such as Processing,
ImageMagick, Arduino and Pure Data hints at a similar desire to take
technology out of the confined box of pre-defined applications.
Designers program posters,
software developers perform live-code,
artists develop software-art.
And more importantly, interdisciplinary teams work together
in-between technology, science and visual production.

**Re-imagining practice** We initiated the Libre Graphics Research
Unit because we understand that in order to develop innovative tools for
creative practice, designers and artists need to do more than file bugs
and design pretty logos for their favourite F/LOSS applications. We need
to link together knowledge, skills and experiences. Imagining future
tools means imagining future practices.



Network
-------

Constant, Medialab Prado, WORM and Piksel are actively engaged in F/LOSS
and Free Culture and have met at various projects, events and festivals.
Through these exchanges we discovered our shared interest in changing
the default tools by which creative practice is performed.

Free software development and artistic practice are both driven by
self-motivated individuals that do not per se thrive in an institutional
context. Work is more often than not volunteer based, globally networked
and versatile. Its precarious nature requires a flexible structure that
loads as little administrative weight as possible on participants. We
therefore formed a relatively small consortium of four European media
labs, networked to smaller associate partners across Europe. The planned
activities then relate to specific organisations, teams and individuals.

The Research Unit functions as a travelling lab, bringing local design-
and art cultures as well as different professional cultures in contact
with each other. The associated organisations show the range of fields
covered: Art and design practice, art education, computer science, Free
Software and activism. The networked is supported by additional relevant
organisations: the Electronic Frontier Foundation (international and
NO), Chaos Computer Club (Berlin, DE), The Participatory Culture
Foundation (international), goto10.org (Poitiers, FR), apo33.org
(Nantes, FR) and The World Wide Web Consortium (international and
Madrid, ES).


### Team

Continuity between activities is maintained through the work of the
LGRU-team. Representing the coorganisers and associate organisation,
they are responsible for the implementation of the project. As
artist-researchers they feed discussions in quarterly research meetings,
maintain the (virtual) library, and present intermediate results on the
LGRU-website and at international public events.

Activities
----------

The F/LOSS community presents an interesting model for
collaborative development of software but lacks the impetus and
resources to innovate beyond a view of creative practice bound by the
current status quo. Activities proposed in the context of the LGRU try
to fill this gap. The research will be cross-disciplinary and
extra-academic out of necessity, drawing from both theory and practice.

Workterrains: Interface research, (science-)fiction as a tool, usability
studies, futurology, speculative standards, radical usability, media
theory, anthropology of practice.


### Commissions

At the core of the project is a series of 5 research commissions that
allow artists and software developers to work together at the same
level. The commissions are not described in detail yet on purpose
because we think that this is to be done collaboratively in the context
of the LGRU. By December 2011, organisers formulate the projects to be
worked on by interdisciplinary teams. Constant, Piksel and WORM act as
'sparring partners', checking up on progress and making sure that the
issue of documentation is properly addressed. Each commission results in
a visual online documentation, a proof of concept and a presentation at
the final conference.


An example of such a commission:

#### Decentralized drawing [example]

An illustrator working on international projects is matched with a
software developer involved in Inkscape and the Open Clip Art Library
are commissioned to work on modular "object libraries" of cooperatively
designed drawing elements. They each have different perspectives on the
way imagery is produced and can be shared and explore existing tools and
software libraries to test out what it would mean for drawing to be
networked and on-line. What assets would you need, what potential tools
can be re-applied, changed, connected together? They log their
discussions and thoughts on a weblog and produce a 'screencast' touring
through their ideas. The sketch is accompanied by a list of requirements
and a technical plan.


### The Reader

The reader is a critical tool for defining, developing and supporting
the work at the Research Unit. Over the course of two years it will
develop into a teaching tool that makes LGRU-research accessible to
design students and young professionals. This reader will provide them
with accessible theory so that they can put the radical changes that are
taking place in their profession into perspective.

The editorial team consists of an interdisciplinary and international
group of designers, theoreticians and developers who will use existing
and commissioned resources to study the relation between design practice
and tools, to question how developments in digital media have an impact
on the design discipline and who will look into the debate on Free,
Libre and Open Source Software, open content and open standards.

The reader is articulated around the four themes that are central to the
work at the LGRU: "Networked Graphics", "Co-Position", "Piksels and
Lines" and finally "Abstracting Craft". However it doesn't exclude other
themes to be included if necessary. For each research meeting, the
editorial team prepares a collection of relevant texts that can help
focus and contextualize the session. On the other hand, the meetings
will be an opportunity for feedback to the proposed material.

### Research meetings

Research meetings are regular meetings between co-organisers (8
participants), associated organisations (6 participants) plus 5 guests
that bring fresh input to the topic of the meeting. In addition, anyone
interested can contribute to the discussions via online chat.

These seasonal sessions favour exchange between participants with very
different disciplinary backgrounds. The meetings welcome experimental,
explorative and speculative work and last 5 days. They are an intense
mix of brainstorms, presentations, informal exchanges and code sprints
and include time for responding to the intermediate results of the
commissioned projects.

Each meeting is organised around a predefined topic but can be adjusted
if the team decides it necessary to do so. The host organisation is
responsible for defining the program of the meeting. In dialogue with
the team they invite guests and take care of the overall practical
organisation. Each meeting is documented on the LGRU-wiki.


#### Networked graphics

The web has changed our perspective on creative production; work has
become networked and distributed, challenging conventional ideas about
specialism and professialism. It has changed the relation between users
and producers: end-users become pro-users, or at least in theory. What
does it mean when we ''make ''on-line and off-desktop, and how do we
respond to the inextricable linkage between technology, content and
form? What assets would we need, what tools can be re-applied, changed,
connected together? Guests: OpenClipArtLibrary, GIT, SVN, Identica,
Mozilla Europe, Inkscape, Institute for Network Cultures.

More about [Networked graphics](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/lab/wiki/index.php/Networked_graphics)

- Organised and hosted by: WORM, Rotterdam (NL)


#### Co-position

To re-imagine lay-out from scratch, we start with an analysis of the
history of lay-out (from moveable type to compositing engines) in order
to better understand relations between workflow, material and media.
Looking at emerging tools for doing lay-out differently, we sketch ideas
for tools that combine elements of canvas editing, dynamic lay-out,
networked lay-out, web-to-print and Print on Demand.
Guests: Scribus, TeX, OSP, APO33, FontMatrix, Mute.

More about [Co-position](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/lab/wiki/index.php/Co-position)

- Organised by: Constant & Manufactura Independente
- Host: Brussel (BE)


#### Piksels and lines

This research meeting focuses on a critical assessment of current free
and open technologies for image creation: both pixel, vector and
generative softwares that support the creation and manipulation of
visuals. In addition to project co-organizers and associate partners, we
invite artists, designers and developers connected to CCC, GIMP,
Inkscape, W3C (SVG-workinggroup), Pure Data, OpenRaster and Processing.
A critical reflection on current technologies, as well as a brainstorm
on improvements and potential connections between existing tools.

- Organised and hosted by: Piksel, Bergen (NO)


#### Abstracting craft

Manuals could be considered as an important interface between end-users
and software programmers, often overlooked as a platform for
collaborative fiction about future tools. Using the well-known format of
the booksprint (a group of self-motivated people with varying skills
writes a manual for a specific set of tools in a short amount of time)
as point of departure, we write a manual about how to *design* a
typeface, as well as how to *produce* it using specific software. A case
study looking at the relation between learning, development and
creation. Guests: OpenFontLibrary, OSP, The Unicode Consortium and
Debian/Ubuntu font teams.

- Organised by: WORM & FLOSS-Manuals
- Host: Rotterdam (NL)


### Conference: Future Tools

In order to gather the results of two years of research and
experimentation, to inspire the participants in the upcoming
*Interactivos?* workshop and to discuss project outcomes with a critical
public, we will organise an international conference, inviting all
partners and associates to share results. 3 international keynote
speakers will address the issues we have been looking at, basing their
talk on intermediate results published on the LGRU website. The
conference functions as an additional moment of reflection, but most of
all as a way to present the work to a larger audience.

3 keynote speakers, 5 presentations of commissioned projects, 3-5 talks
by associates/coorganisers. Simultaneously translated in English and
Spanish and live-broadcast on the web. Audience: 350-400 participants.

- Organised and hosted by: Medialab Prado, Madrid (ES)


### Workshop: Interactivos?'13

*Interactivos?* is a research and production platform for creative and
educational uses of technology. Its main goal is to expand the use of
electronic and software tools for artists, designers and educators, thus
contributing to the development of local communities of cultural
producers in this field. The 2013 edition of *Interactivos?* will focus
on networked graphics and take place in Madrid and Rotterdam
simultaneously.

*Interactivos?* events are a hybrid between a production workshop, a
seminar and a showcase. A space for reflection, research, and intensive
collaborative work is created, in which several projects previously
selected by an international open call are developed in
transdisciplinary work groups composed by the author of the proposal and
the interested collaborators. Within two weeks, the works are completed
and set up in an exhibition. The process is open to the public from
beginning to end.

*Interactivos?* is an open platform:

- Structured around open calls for projects, papers and collaborators.
- Seminars and workshops are open to the public from the beginning to
  the end.
- Trandisciplinary work groups are established and connected first
  through an on-line forum (before the event starts) and then in the
  physical space in a self-organized and negociated process between
  participants.
- Participants are encouraged to prepare proper documentation for the
  developed projects, both during and after the workshop, and to
  publish the results and source code under licenses that grant access
  and distribution of the knowledge produced during the workshop.

Ca. 8 teams (60 participants) of artists, engineers, musicians,
programmers, hackers, designers, architects, psychologists, educators,
anthropologists, magicians, biologists, physicist, etc. Teams are
supported by 2 project tutors plus technical advisors and cultural
mediators.

- Organised and hosted by: Medialab Prado, Madrid (ES)


Communication and dissemination
-------------------------------

Communication and dissemination are important to the work at the LGRU.
In the first period we focus on communicating between participants and
relevant professional fields. During the last 6 months of the project,
the attention shifts to involving a larger audience through the *Libre
Graphics Infopoint*, *Conference*, *Interactivos?-*workshop and on-line
publication. An interested audience is welcome to follow the proceedings
of the research as intermediate results will be made available under a
free licence from the start. In order to do this, the project devices
the following tools:

- LGRU-mailinglist, IRC-channel and wiki: Classic set of tools for
  communicating news and materials between project participants. All
  channels are open for interested (future) participants.
- GIT: Versioning platform specialized for hosting software and it's
  versions. Although code development is not at the core of the
  project, we will certainly produce material that is better shared in
  a code repository. Useful for designers, artists, software
  developers.
- LGRU-website: The LGRU website is the public face of the project.
  Using a flexible Content Management System that each of the partners
  can administrate, this site will offer an easily accessible index to
  documents (images, sketches, code, writing), on- and off-line
  activities and research.
- Future Tools conference: dissemination of outcomes through lectures,
  presentations and demonstrations
- Interactivos?'13 exhibition: showcasing 8 projects of fresh work
  with and about Libre Graphics.

### Libre Graphics Infopoint

In 2012, Medialab-Prado hosts the *Libre Graphics Info Point* for a
period of 6 months, an open studio where everyone, whether professional
artist, designer or general public, is welcome to produce graphics with
Free Software tools. There is a computers, a printer and scanner
available and the Infopoint is maintained and animated by a cultural
mediator. The Infopoint is a pilot to see what kind of working
environment we could build with Free Software tools and how to favour
exchange and networking between professionals and amateurs.

### Archive sprint

Although much archiving will be done along the way, we want to take care
to not end the project with poor documents and little reflection on how
to proceed. We would like to organise a last meeting that has no other
agenda than gathering, evaluating, and preparing for a continuation. The
sprint lasts a maximum of three days and involves the LGRU-team plus
those people that have been documenting the project.

- Organised by: Constant & Manufactura Independente
- Host: Porto (PT)

### On-line publication

Near the end of the project, texts and possibly other material will be
gathered in an on-line publication that will be distributed through the
LGRU website and the FLOSS-manual platforms. The publication will be of
course designed using Free, Libre and Open Source tools, typefaces and
licenses. The collection of texts is made available under an open
content license.

### Sustainability

- Network economic effects: The drive to not only imagine new futures
  for design but to build the tools to support them has unquantifiable
  potential for network economic effects. The direct development of
  new tools presents both amateur and professional practitioners new
  modes for design. Publicized by the conference, the software
  imagined and developed by the LGRU will become an active part of the
  discourse of code and practice in the fields of generative design,
  type, and F/LOSS.
- Open Content Licenses: All material produced in the context of the
  Libre Graphics Research Unit will be released under an open content
  license. For software, we chose the
  GNU General Public License[^]{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html},
  and for other content Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
  3.0[^]{http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/} or similar.
  These licenses allow anyone to freely use, reproduce, distribute and
  alter the materials generated within the project.
- On-line archive: reports, results, documentation remains available
  for at least three years after the end of the project.

### Master Media Design and Communication: Networked Media + Lectorate: Communication in a Digital Age (Rotterdam, NL)

The Masters programme considers critical reflection as a necessary
prerequisite for any advanced media practice. The focus of the course is
on computational, networked, digital media and information systems.
Rather than taking information technology off-the-shelf or
out-of-the-box, the course encourages students to rethink and design
their own media. This is why Free and Open Source Software and a
do-it-yourself ethic play a key role in the programme.

The Masters course in Media Design & Communication is affiliated with
the international research programme, Communication in a Digital Age at
the Piet Zwart Institute. This project investigates the future of
communication design in relation to the most current technological and
social developments of media and communication.

[<http://pzwart.wdka.nl/networked-media>](http://pzwart.wdka.nl/networked-media)

_Through their participation in meetings and events, students and
researchers involved in the Networked Media programme will relay their
experimental design and programming work to the LGRU and vice versa.
From their experience in rethinking and designing media, they will act
as respondents to commissions both in terms of how they are formulated
and subsequently followed through.:

### Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Trondheim, NO)

The Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI) is part of the
Faculty of Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical
Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(NTNU). The Department counts 50 permanent staff members and 100 PhD
students who conduct research in many fields of computer and information
science; ranging from hardware related research to research on the
social implications of information systems.

The general goal of the research carried out at ArTe is to increase
knowledge about the interdisciplinary intersection between digital art
and software technology. Their research questions explore the interplay
between artwork, technology, artist, and audience.

ArTe focuses on technologies such as Arduino, processing, and scratch,
which enable a broad audience to become makers of digital artistic
expressions. ArTe researchers exploit well-defined research methods,
supported by qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis
techniques, to design and execute valid research studies.

[<http://artentnu.com/>](http://artentnu.wordpress.com/)

_From their work on the intersection of art and technology, ArTe/NTNU
acts as an interface between academic and artistic research in
technology and feeds the reflection on the interaction between both.
From their work on 'Openness' (licenses, formats, and tools), ArTe
complements the work at the LGRU and helps keeping research goals and
methods on focus._

### CREATE (International)

Catalyzing communication and sharing between Free and Open Source
creative software communities, CREATE is the umbrella organisation for
all Libre Graphics applications: Gimp, Inkscape, Scribus and many
others. CREATE co-organizes the yearly Libre Graphics Meeting, where
developers developers, artists, designers and other graphics
professionals have the opportunity to collaborate and learn from each
other.

[<http://create.freedesktop.org>](http://create.freedesktop.org/)

_CREATE act as a sounding board and is indispensable for networking to
Libre Graphics developers and teams that will participate in
commissions, research meetings and workshop. Through CREATE we involve
existing F/LOSS software projects from the start, and ensure that our
research can benefit the Libre Graphics community and vice versa._
