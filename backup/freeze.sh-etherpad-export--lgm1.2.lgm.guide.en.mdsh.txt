% TITLE: A Reader's Guide to _Libre Graphics Magazine_
% {goes maybe on masthead page}

In this magazine, you may find concepts, words, ideas and things 
which are new to you. Good. That means your horizons are expanding. 
The problem with that, of course, is that sometimes, things with 
steep learning curves are less fun than those without. 

That's why we're trying to flatten the learning curve. If, while 
reading _Libre Graphics_ magazine, you encounter an unfamiliar 
word, project name, whatever it may be, chances are good there's an 
explanation. 

At the back of this magazine, you'll find a glossary and resource 
list. The glossary aims to define words that are unique to the world 
of Libre Graphics. The resource list provides valuable information 
about tools, licenses, whatever items we may be mentioning. 

Practically, this means that if, for example, you're reading an 
% article about Scribus (see pages {number} to {number}), you can 
article about Scribus, you can
always flip to the back of the magazine, look up Scribus in the 
resource list and become quickly informed about it. This provides 
some instant gratification, giving you the resources you need to 
understand, in a moment, just what we're talking about.

We hope you like our system.
