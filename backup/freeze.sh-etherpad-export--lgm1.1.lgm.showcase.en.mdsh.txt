% RUBRIK: Showcase

By virtue of being called a showcase, we assume that you already know 
quite a bit about this section. Many design and art publications 
prominently feature work in their excitingly glossy pages. 

The difference, of course, between our showcase and those others is 
that we do care about the process and tool chain behind the works we 
show. For that reason, every work featured in this section has been 
created using F/LOSS graphics programs. Sometimes, those F/LOSS tools 
are among other techniques. Sometimes, they are the only tool in use. 

Our goal, in the showcase, is to show you just how stunning F/LOSS 
graphics can be. We hope you'll agree that the works on these pages 
are exciting, well crafted and very much worth pulling out and 
sticking to your walls.
