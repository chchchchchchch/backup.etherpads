% TITLE: The graphic side of 3D printing
% RUBRIK Showcase

There's a little revolution taking place in basements, garages and 
hackerspaces. 3D printers --machines which turn digital meshes into 
physical objects-- are getting cheaper, better and more popular. 
We've collected samples of some strikingly graphic 3D prints, 
designed with F/LOSS tools. 

All of the projects featured in this showcase are available from 
Thingiverse (http://thingiverse.com), under permissive licenses,
for printing and modification.
