% TITLE: FF3300
% RUBRIK: Showcase

FF3300 is the hexadecimal code for orange. It's also the name of a 
magazine started in 2006 and of a visual communication studio based 
in Bari, founded in 2008 by Alessandro Tartaglia, Carlotta Latessa 
and Nicol√≤ Loprieno.

Their website claims that they believe in the power of ideas, in 
design method and in culture. There is no better way to describe 
their approach to communication. It perfectly underlines the great 
responsibility they feel towards both the final communication aims 
and the underlying processes, giving both an important role in the 
project.

The experimental approach is not restricted to the conceptual area, 
but impacts the visual and technological spheres as well. FF3300 
pushes new ways of perceiving communication, through generative 
graphics and cool design choices.
