% TITLE: Breaking into F/LOSS
% BY: Morgan Fortems
% RUBRIK: First time

My associates and I have always been vigilant – without being 
activists or pioneers – to the alternative software tools we can 
use to oppose the dictates of manufacturers and habits in our fields 
(graphics, video, photography). Our first moves were primarily 
motivated by economic choices (we could not afford to buy all the 
necessary software) or technical problems (to meet needs that 
proprietary software does not cover or to solve incompatibilities). 

It seems that today the practice of alternative solutions has became 
more accessible, as it has left the realm of developers and has risen 
to meet the needs of professional workflows.
  
So far, we have easily implemented simple F/LOSS applications or 
plug-ins in the daily routine of the studio without impairing our 
efficiency or our relationship with customers and suppliers. 

For now, we don't see F/LOSS as a major threat to the status quo but, 
for ourselves, it is time to consider new methods. We decided to 
train with small internal projects and master these new methods and 
F/LOSS tools before switching over completely. For example, and among 
other things, we are currently developing the layout of our new 
fanzine, Mmagazine, in Scribus and we are using  Libertinage, a font 
licensed under the Open Font License, for the identity of a concert 
hall.

I had some apprehensions about leaving behind a precious bit of 
technical know-how, built over almost a decade, but my very first 
steps with Scribus and my meetings with specialists convinced me. We 
are so far on the way of atonement that Damien, one of my associates, 
plans to "liberate" his Mac during a Pizza/Beer/Ubuntu party!
