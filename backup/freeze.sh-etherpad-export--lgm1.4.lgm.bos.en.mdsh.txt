Best of SVG: Maps

Even blank maps can tell a history. 
Just browse the colletion of Blank World Maps offered by Wikimedia 
Commons and OpenStreetMap, set your eyes on the ever changing 
boundaries of countries and nations. 
Being SVG, they are doubly useful: one, you get 
resolution-independent maps, allowing you to scale them without 
mercy. Two, SVG makes them perfect for including in a web application 
or visualization, creating experimental programs around geographic 
data, and for clever maps that embed additional cartographic data in 
the file itself.
It's a journey through history in SVG shapes.
