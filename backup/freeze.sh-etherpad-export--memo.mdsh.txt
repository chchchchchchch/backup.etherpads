**Freeze+Press** is driven by curiosity for the explorative
use of software for _Printmaking_.
% RESETFONT:

_Print_ as synthesized or manipulated visual content on a surface,
_Making_ not as streamlined production but as creative matter to 
engage with. F/L/OS Software provides the environment for these 
adventures. Software that is free. Free to use, study or modify.
Free not like without cost, but like priceless, namely disclosed
to make modifications to some streamlined purpose.


## Free/Libre/Open Source?

Along the rise of digital technology an exciting culture developed.
Initially connected to the production and use of software it started
to spread to all kinds of different fields. To put it short:
A model that supports development and innovation is employed instead
of restrictive copyright. The idea is to build a body of shared
resources, that may be used by anybody for any mean, while respecting
the rights of the commons. This has been practised for software for
about 30 years and brought us great things like GNU/Linux, Wikipedia
and the Internet. Free/Libre/Open Source Software is a legal and
ideological framework that conserves the right of users to interact
with their software, namely to copy, study, change and improve it.

% TEXINJECT: \bigskip

**Freeze+Press** tries to contribute to a digital culture that preserves
the right of people to interact with their surrounding as a matter of 
principle. Interaction not as superficial mode of operation but to the 
extent that makes things possible never thought of.
% This book collects, combines and builds upon software, texts, graphics 
% and more from the generous world of Free Culture. In reverse best effort
% is made to share and make _this work_ comprehensible, not only as concluded

This book collects and combines own and adopted software, texts, graphics 
from the ecosystem of Free Culture and beyond.
Best effort was made to share and make _this work_ comprehensible,
not only as concluded object but also as a process.
Every end is a potential start for something new.
