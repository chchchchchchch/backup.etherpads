% TITLE: What Revolution?
% BY: Antonio Roberts

_What Revolution?_ is the first in a series of images challenging 
the ideas of celebrity and idols. The 1960 photograph of Che Guevara 
by Alberto Korda has been endlessly mutated, transformed, and 
morphed. It can be found advertising anything from belts and "hip and 
cool" t-shirts to health insurance. It is tacked onto political 
movements without much consideration of the history behind it. One 
has to ask if his image is still the symbol for change and revolution 
that it was fifty years ago, when it was furiously distributed 
throughout Europe by Jim Fitzpatrick in protest of the conditions of 
Guevera's murder.

The vector image of Che was glitched using a C script written by 
Garry Bulmer. The script randomises the position and other values of 
the nodes in the file. The background is a random image found on the 
Internet tagged with "Revolution," which was then glitched many times 
using UCNV's Glitchpng Ruby script. To get the sharp colours, I 
reduced the image from 8 bits to 1 bit using ImageMagick. All of the 
separate elements were then recomposed in Inkscape.
