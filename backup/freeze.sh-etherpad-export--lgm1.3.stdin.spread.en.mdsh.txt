There seems to a be a tendency nowadays for collaboration and 
cross-disciplinarity, and graphic designers are not at rest. Many 
designers — including ourselves — are increasivelly working 
together with artists, thinkers or engineers, blurring the separation 
between the disciplines. Why? Could it be a way to escape from the 
division of labour? A way to escape from the thinking of graphic 
design as a service industry and to start thinking of design as an 
embedded process? Our intuition is that graphic designers don't want 
to be the last element of the production line anymore.

Coming from a classical visual design education we became more and 
more interested in digital culture and networked media. Now, we mix a 
visual approach with programming to create designs for print and 
non-print outputs. We proudly claim the two hats of designer and 
programmer because for us programming is also design. Moreover, we 
think programs are cultural items, at least as much as they are 
functional. F/LOSS carries this thought, but using it doesn't 
necessarily imply free culture. This is why we focus our personal 
researches on collective platforms based on F/LOSS. Sharing is not 
only about giving, it's also about getting back, it's about starting 
a discussion.
